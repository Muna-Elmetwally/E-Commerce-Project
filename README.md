## Story of How Our Project Was Inspired:
Our project was inspired by the need for a comprehensive mobile store offering maintenance services, accessories and all mobile needs, courses and training for that field. A store that can provide all of these services online with unique expertise.
Most of mobile store are not unique enough and provide the same service so what if we enable the user to get 5-stars service in a one place that provide all services that are related to mobile phones technology with good prices and professional and organized usage .
Personal experiences with mobile device issues and the lack of a one-stop solution motivated us to create Al-Ostaz Mobile Store.
It’s not just a mobile store it will be a great educational source and maybe a platform in the future that will assist people to find their passion easily.
We will also provide a chatbot in the future to provide more assistance and dark mode.

## Built With
# Technologies Used:
Frontend Technologies
HTML: Structure of the whole web pages (10 web pages).
CSS: Styling and, animation and transitions, layout, ensuring responsiveness and the hover method, import fonts and images.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic content.
creating features like drop-down menus, image sliders which can enhance the user experience. 
create a smooth and interactive user interface like switching between the sign-up and sign-in forms. 
“When the user clicks the "Sign Up" button, the container element is assigned the "right-panel-active" class, which likely triggers a CSS-based animation or transition to slide the sign-up form into view.  Conversely, when the user clicks the "Sign In" button, the "right-panel-active" class is removed, causing the sign-in form to become visible. (present both sign-up and sign-in options within a single page, without the need for a full page refresh)

DOM Manipulation: JavaScript provides the ability to access and modify the Document Object Model (DOM), which is the structured representation of the HTML elements on your web page. This allows you to create, update, or remove elements dynamically.
Event Handling: JavaScript enables you to write code that responds to user actions, such as button clicks, mouse movements, or form submissions. This creates a more responsive and interactive web experience.
Validation and Feedback
Vue.js: Framework for building the user interface and handling state management.
The code of  a Vue.js application is setting up with a list of products, a shopping cart, and methods to manage the cart and checkout process. The "currency" filter – takes a value parameter – is used to format numeric values as currency within the Vue templates.specifically in the format "EGP [value]" with the value displayed to two decimal places.


Frontend Architecture
Component-Based Structure:
Reusable Components: Buttons, cards, product listings.
Routing:
Vue Router: Handles navigation and routing between pages., It’s the official router for Vue.js, used to create and manage the routing in a Vue.js application,  ensuring users can navigate between different pages or components seamlessly. As we used it in sign-up and login web page

Responsive Design:
Flexbox: CSS layout model for flexible and responsive design, 
CSS Grid: Advanced layout system for grid-based designs
Cross-Browser Compatibility with CSS Prefixes (for browser makers to add support for new CSS features)
common prefixes include:
-webkit- for Chrome, Safari, and newer versions of Opera.
-moz- for Firefox.
-o- for older versions of Opera.
-ms- for Internet Explorer and Edge.

Backend Technologies:
Python: For server-side logic.
Flask: Backend framework for handling API requests.
